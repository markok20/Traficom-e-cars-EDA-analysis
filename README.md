Traficom e-cars EDA analysis

Traficom's open data: Finland will register these fully electric cars in 2021-2022!

What are the most popular all-electric models and the most popular all-electric brands in first registrations from 2021? Geographically, where in Finland were the first registrations of all-electric cars the most?

I looked for answers to these questions when I went through the open data material of vehicles on Traficom's website. Open data for vehicles contains registration, approval and technical information of all vehicles in traffic from the register  maintained by Traficom.

The material can be found at: https://tieto.traficom.fi/fi/tietotraficom/avoin-data?toggle=Ajoneuvojen%20avoin%20data

The data contained a total of 5,163,487 rows and was published on February 12, 2023. 

From the database, I only extracted data from passenger cars (vehicle classes M1 and M1G) and limited it to those registered for the first time since the beginning of 2021. 

35,494 fully electric cars were registered in the period. I processed the data with Python.

I looked answers for these questions:

What are the most popular fully electric car brands?

What are the most popular fully electric car models?

What are the most popular commercial names for fully electric cars? The names of Tesla's commercial models are in first and second place.

Geographically, where in Finland were the first registrations of all-electric cars the most?
